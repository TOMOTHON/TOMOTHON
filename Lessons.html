					<p class="module"> This was my first ever project of the course. In it, we were to design our own drama game (or Team Building Activity as Mr. Steckley put it)
						in order to get familiar with others, build relationships, develop trust, foster group interaction, stimulate creative thinking, and create a postive group 
						culture. The point was to get everyone as a group participating in your game, without anyone feeling left out or with unfair advantages. </p>

					<p class="module">All of a sudden, the ground becomes flypaper! Everybody's feet are stuck to the ground, and they can no longer move around!</p>
					<p class="module"> In order for the flies to escape, they have to work as a team in order to fly off of the trap.</p>
					<p class="module">One person, the "Lord of the Flies" will start by pointing at and calling the name of another fly. </p>
					<p class="module">Each subsequent fly has to point to and call the name of another fly that hasn't already been pointed at until the last fly has been 
						called. </p>
					<p class="module">	At this point, the last fly has to point to the first fly who started the chain and call their name. </p>
					<p class="module">If done succesfully, the flies as a team are able to outstrength the trap, and are free to buzz off around the room again.</p>

					<p class="module"> The game was fun and engaging, and I was able to lead through it effectively from beginning to end.</p>
					<p class="module"> I had an excellent introduction and explanation of the rules, and the instructions were easy and simple to follow.</p>
					<p class="module"> I provided great enthusiasm and energy, and made sure that everyone was able to participate.</p>
					<p class="module"> Also, one of the criteria for the game was that each round was supposed to progress in a way to make it more challenging. I did so 
						by adding changes to initial game, such as only one foot stuck to the ground at a time, or a hand stuck to the ground. </p>

					<p class="module"> Servant leadership means that you put others before yourself, you give others your time and effort rather than just your money, and you 
						help others without wanting anything in return. </p>
					<p class="module"> It is literally in the name. Servant leadership means Serving others.</p>
					<p class="module"> Servant Leadership is the most effective style of leadership, because it's layered on top of every other style. </p>
					<p class="module"> In democratic leadership, you are making sure that everyone else learns along the way. In autocratic, you are making sure everyone is doing
						their job. In Laissez-Faire, you are making sure that everyone's true potential is reached. In every case, it's never about what YOU provide, but what you
						are doing to help OTHERS provide. </p>
